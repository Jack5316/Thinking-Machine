### Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is **Jiawei Tan (Jack)**, and I’m passionate about leveraging advanced technology to enhance productivity and improve quality of life. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong interest in both hardware and software, and I’m excited to share my journey, experiences, and insights with you.

### My Academic Background
I’m currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Science and Technology** at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, with a final GPA of **3.7**. Next year, I’ll be starting my **Master of Science in Computer Science** at **University College London (UCL)**. This transition from hardware-focused studies to software and computer science reflects my growing interest in the intersection of these two fields.

### My Experience in Hardware and Research
During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work as a **Research Assistant** and a **Hardware Engineer**. These roles allowed me to dive deep into circuit design, simulation, and prototyping. Some highlights include:
- **Research Assistant (Jun 2021 - Aug 2021)**: I surveyed state-of-the-art research on CMOS logic inverters, designed circuits, and presented my findings in a poster and presentation.
- **Hardware Engineer (Jun 2023 - Sept 2023)**: I worked on selecting electronic components, designing circuit boards using Altium Designer, and testing prototypes in the lab.

These experiences taught me the importance of precision, problem-solving, and collaboration in engineering.

### My Interest in Software and Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
While my academic background is rooted in hardware, I’ve always been fascinated by software development and productivity tools. I’ve experimented with various **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** apps like **Notion**, **Obsidian**, **Logseq**, and **Tana** to organize my thoughts, projects, and learning. These tools have not only improved my productivity but also deepened my understanding of how technology can enhance creativity and efficiency.

### Why I’m Pursuing Computer Science
As I transition to **Computer Science** for my master’s degree, I’m excited to explore topics like **algorithms**, **data structures**, **computer architecture**, and **operating systems**. My goal is to bridge the gap between hardware and software, creating innovative solutions that leverage the strengths of both fields.

---

### My Career Prospects
Looking ahead, I aspire to work in roles that combine hardware and software, such as **embedded systems development**, **IoT (Internet of Things)**, or **AI hardware acceleration**. I’m particularly interested in how emerging technologies like **machine learning** and **quantum computing** can revolutionize the way we design and interact with hardware.

### What’s Next?
In future blog posts, I’ll dive deeper into specific topics like:
- My experience with PKM tools and how they’ve transformed my workflow.
- Insights from my transition from hardware to software.
- Tutorials and guides on topics like circuit design, Python programming, and algorithm optimization.
